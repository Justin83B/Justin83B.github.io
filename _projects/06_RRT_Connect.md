### Preface
This was a project from the class ROB 320 in which I was taught to use the motion planning algorithm rrt connect to motion plan for a robot with nth dimensional DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robot. This project builds off of the work of my <a href="/projects/inverse_kinematics">Inverse Kinematics Project</a> I also did in this class.
