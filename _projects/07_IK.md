### Preface
This was a project from the class ROB 320 in which I was taught to implement an Nth dimensional Inverse Kinematics algorithm that takes in a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file and builds the kinematic chain. Inverse Kinematics is the process of calculating the arrangement of a robots links and joints in order to make the end effector reach a certain place in the world.

### In Action
Here is a video of a my IK algorithm using a URDF of a fetch robot to navigate its arm to over a hundred points in under a minute.

### Fun Bonus
Here is a simple dance routine I made for the class using a custom URDF.
I based this off a Boston Dynamics video that I remembered seeing when I was younger. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHBcVlqpvZ8">Original Video</a>
