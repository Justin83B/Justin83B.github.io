### Preface
This is the final project from the class ROB 102 which I took in the fall of my freshman year. In the following years I came back as an instructional aid to help teach and improve the class. The final project combines the use of a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or A* and a neural network to navigate through a maize identifying numbers on the wall as it goes. The course likes to call it a Robot Tour Guide.
